# 8-ball

This is a magic 8 ball program that outputs various answers at random to any questions you have. This was my first "difficult" program I wrote. I was stuck on it for so long just to realize how much a few little typos can make a program not run. Thankfully in one of our group meetings you were able to help me out and fix the problem.
